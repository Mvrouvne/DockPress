# DockPress

## Overview

The **DockPress** project focuses on building a secure, production-ready environment using Docker and Docker Compose. The project involves configuring and running multiple services such as NGINX, WordPress, and MariaDB within separate containers, orchestrating their communication, and ensuring that all components function seamlessly together.

## Features

- **NGINX as a reverse proxy**: Configure NGINX to serve as a reverse proxy for WordPress, providing secure HTTPS connections.
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Integrate TLS (SSL) to secure communication between the server and clients using Let's Encrypt.
- **WordPress Deployment**: Set up a fully functional WordPress instance inside a Docker container for easy content management.
- **MariaDB Database**: Use MariaDB in a container to manage persistent data for the WordPress installation.
- **Docker Compose**: Use Docker Compose to handle multi-container orchestration, ensuring that all services work together.
- **Secure Web Environment**: Configure firewalls, security headers, and HTTPS to ensure a safe web infrastructure.

## Key Concepts

- **Containerization**: Learn how to isolate applications and their dependencies using Docker containers.
- **Reverse Proxy Setup**: Use NGINX to direct traffic between the web server and backend services like WordPress.
- **Service Orchestration**: Manage and scale the deployment of multiple services with Docker Compose.
- **Security**: Implement secure HTTPS connections using NGINX and TLS certificates.
- **Database Management**: Set up and manage persistent storage for WordPress through MariaDB.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing **DockPress**, you will:

- Gain hands-on experience in building and deploying multi-service applications using Docker.
- Learn to configure NGINX as a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS support for secure communication.
- Understand how to manage a WordPress instance in a containerized environment.
- Gain expertise in managing databases with Dockerized MariaDB and ensuring persistent data storage.
